# Rock Paper Scissors in C++

This repository contains a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in C++. The player can play against the computer in a best-of-three format. The game is designed with basic C++ constructs, making it an ideal project for beginners to understand basic input/output, loops, and conditionals in C++.

## Features
- **Console-based interaction**: Play against the computer directly in the terminal.
- **Randomized computer moves**: The computer randomly chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Best of three rounds**: The game is played in a best-of-three format, where the first player (either user or computer) to win two rounds is declared the overall winner.

## How to Play
1. The game will prompt you to input your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer will randomly select its move.
3. The game will announce the winner of the round.
4. After three rounds, the overall winner is declared.
